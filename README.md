## 10: DOM

their is not a specific arrangement for reading

after reading, also check BOM from w3schools

events


browser APIs (like setTimeout, fetch)

## 11 : javascript behind the scenes

check this from 'chai our javascript' code execution video

or namaste javascript

and some bookmarked blogs by freecodecamp + medium




---


## AJAX 


before getting started with fetch, you should learn about :

ajax

xmlhttprequest

how requests were sent before fetch api

this will help you understand asynchronous javascript

(during learning, you should have the only basic knowledge of http status code, we will check this in node js)
