// The sessionStorage object let you store key/value pairs in the browser.

// Session storage is a feature in web browsers that allows web applications to store and access data within the user's browser session. Unlike local storage, which persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, session storage is cleared when the browser session ends but it can survive on reloading the page, typically when the user closes the browser window or tab. This makes it suitable for temporarily storing data that is only needed during a particular browsing session.





// Session storage provides a simple key-value storage mechanism that can be used to store data such as user preferences, form data, or other temporary information needed by a web application. It is commonly used by web developers to enhance the user experience by enabling the storage of temporary data without the need for server-side storage or cookies.






// Persistence: 
// The main difference between session storage and local storage is their persistence. Session storage is cleared when the browser session ends, while local storage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. This means that data stored in session storage is temporary and is only available during the current browsing session, whereas data stored in local storage remains available across multiple browsing sessions.
