Undefined

The Undefined type is inhabited by exactly one value: undefined.
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

Example

let car; 
console.log(car);              //undefined
console.log(typeof car);       //undefined









Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined

let car = undefined;
console.log(car);              //undefined
console.log(typeof car);       //undefined






empty value:

let car = '';
console.log(car);      //prints an empty string (leaves space)
console.log(typeof car);  // string
