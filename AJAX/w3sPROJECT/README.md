## w3school.xml contains data is copied from ['this address'](https://www.w3schools.com/js/cd_catalog.xml);

## data was not accessible from url, so i copied and created my own [xml](https://github.com/raeesmghl/my-javascript-notes/blob/main/AJAX/w3sPROJECT/w3school.xml) file;

## whenever i send a request using xhr, i get a response with with error : 
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://www.w3schools.com/js/cd_catalog.xml' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5500' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
